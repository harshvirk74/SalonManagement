# SalonManagement
Develop a comprehensive plan to build a Content Management System (CMS) for Hairstylist  Winnipeg, a new salon in Winnipeg. This CMS will be constructed using PHP and MySQL  with HTML for front-end design. The CMS will allow the salon owner to manage services,  stylist profiles, and client feedback efficiently.
